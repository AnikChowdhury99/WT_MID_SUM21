    <p>The aim in life is really important if you want to pursue something in your life. Student life is the best time to fix an aim. We all are a student and we should have an aim in life. We need to prepare ourselves to reach our goal. Someone with a fixed goal does a better performance in life than someone who doesn’t have a goal. Your aim or goal will inspire you to work hard, to study hard. And you know, without working hard you can’t be successful.
